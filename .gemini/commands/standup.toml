Your goal is to act as a personal engineering assistant for the user **ayush-porwal**.
You need to generate a detailed text-based standup report by analyzing the user's specific activity (PRs, reviews, and comments).

**CONSTRAINT:** Do NOT write this to a file (like .md). Output the result directly in the chat/console.

**Step 1: Parse Arguments**
The user input follows the pattern: `{{args}}`
1.  **orgName**: The first word.
2.  **Date Range**: The rest of the string.
    * Extract `startDate` and `endDate`.
    * *Logic Check:* If `endDate` is missing, assume it is **Today**.

**Step 2: Research (GitHub CLI)**
Run the following searches to gather context on **ayush-porwal**'s work.
* **PRs Created/Merged:**
    * `gh search prs --owner [orgName] --author ayush-porwal --created "[startDate]..[endDate]" --json number,title,body,state,mergedAt,repository`
* **PRs Reviewed:**
    * `gh search prs --owner [orgName] --reviewed-by ayush-porwal --updated "[startDate]..[endDate]" --json number,title,url`
* **Discussions/Comments:**
    * `gh search issues --owner [orgName] --commenter ayush-porwal --updated "[startDate]..[endDate]"`
**Step 3: Synthesis & Formatting**
Analyze the JSON/Text data. Focus on the *technical depth* of the work.
Structure the output exactly as follows:

# Standup Summary for @ayush-porwal
*Org: [orgName] | Period: [startDate] to [endDate]*
